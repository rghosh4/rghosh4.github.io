## Favourite Plot: Chord Diagram

```{r}
# Create an adjacency matrix: 
# a list of connections between 20 origin nodes, and 5 destination nodes:
numbers <- sample(c(1:1000), 100, replace = T)
data <- matrix( numbers, ncol=5)
rownames(data) <- paste0("orig-", seq(1,20))
colnames(data) <- paste0("dest-", seq(1,5))

# Load the circlize library
library(circlize)
